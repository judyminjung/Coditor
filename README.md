# Coditor

April 2020

This project is a web application similar to Google Docs but specifically tailered for CS students and professionals.
It allows you to create and share note taking documents where you can specifically write in code to your notes where it is correctly formatted and color corrected.

I worked on this with a team (Zhenghao Dai, Abbas Zaidi, Ivan Peng, Hsin Pan, and Shania Jain).
